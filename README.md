I've created a Sentiment Analysis project using Python libraries like NLTK, TextBlob, and Newspaper! 🐍✨

🔍 What it does:

Analyzes text sentiment to determine whether it's positive 😊, negative 😞, or neutral 😐.
Extracts articles from the web and processes them automatically 📰🔧.
Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to clean and analyze text effectively 🧠💡.
🛠 Tech Stack:

NLTK 📚 – Tokenization, stopword removal, and text processing.
TextBlob 🗨️ – Sentiment analysis and text classification.
Newspaper 📰 – Scraping and extracting useful content from web articles.
🚀 Why it's awesome:

Quick and easy sentiment analysis with minimal code 💻⚡.
Helps businesses and individuals understand customer feedback better 📊❤️.
Automates the process of gathering and analyzing online content 🌐🔍.
